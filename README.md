# PMDR

*A simple pomodoro timer and tally in GTK+*

This application is the product of my dissatisfaction with other pomodoro
timers out there. 

PMDR boasts the following features:

- 25 minute "work timers"
- 5 minute breaks after every work session, with 15 minute breaks after every
  4th work session
- Pause / Resume
- Automatically pause after a break ends so that you must explicitly begin the
  next pomodoro
- Keeps a tally of pomodoros
- Lets you reset the pomodoro count
- notifications using the [notify-rust](https://github.com/hoodie/notify-rust)
  crate


I'm going to be honest, I'm a little ashamed to release a pomodoro timer. Such
is life.
